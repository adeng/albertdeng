<p>Revised: 9/2/15 with Q2 earnings</p> 
<p>With brent oil trading sub-50, I thought that it might be a good idea to hedge against cheap oil by purchasing airline companies. In general, one of the largest operating expenses for any airline company is the amount it spends on oil and fuel (although I really wish they would increase the padding in my seats). With oil trading at all-time lows, I believe airlines should be a good investment in the near-term, and what better airline than 2014’s darling growth stock?</p>
<p>In Q2 2014, Southwest spent $1.425 billion on fuel and oil expenses, which dropped to $1.005 billion in Q2 2015. For the first six months of the fiscal year, Southwest spent $1.882 billion in total in 2015, a 31% improvement over the $2.739 billion spent in the first six months of FY 2014. In Q2 2014, fuel and oil made up almost 34% of the company’s operating expenses; in Q2 2015, this percentage dropped to less than 25%. Although Southwest Airlines is famous for its hedging, which prevented its 2014 earnings from taking full advantage of cheap oil prices, the company has closed its hedges, allowing it to reap the benefits of cheap oil (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/22/southwest-fueloil-idUSL1N0V126N20150122">Source</a>). Company estimates place the annual savings at 1.7 billion, which is almost 50% higher than its annual net income!</p> 
<p>The company’s ongoing fleet modernization initiative will also position the company for stronger future growth. Currently, 19% of the company’s fleet consists of the older Boeing 737-300 and 737-500 models. I did spend the last 20 or so minutes researching the fuel effciencies of Boeing 737-700s and 800s versus the older 300 and 500 models, but I was unable to find any definitive numbers. For now, let’s assume there’s a 10% increase in fuel efficiency (in Boeing and CFM International I trust). In 2014, 20% of the company’s fleet consisted of older planes, and fuel costs amounted to $5.293 billion. Supposing the average price the company paid for fuel remained the same, this would result in savings of almost $106 million, which would increase the company’s EPS by almost 6% (using the company’s effective tax rate of 37.4%)! Of course, some of this will be eaten by depreciation, but still, this does bode well for the company’s long-term prospects.</p>
<p>Of course, the largest concern is whether Southwest can maintain its lift-off. Being one of 2014’s best performing stocks, there are concerns that the company may have already run its course. Admittedly, the company’s sales growth is fairly weak; with only 2% sales growth in Q2 2015 and with a 4.6% fall in quarterly PRASM (passenger revenue per available seat mile), Southwest will probably not rival Apple in growth anytime soon. However, the company was still able to eke out a 31% increase in quarterly EPS due to fall in fuel costs. I believe that as long as oil remains cheap, Southwest will continue to post impressive EPS growth.</p>
<p>With a TTM PE of 15.67, well above the airlines industry average TTM PE of 11.28 (source: Fidelity), Southwest is hardly the cheapest airline stock available. It is, however, one of the safer ones (relatively speaking). Being the only airline with investment grade status and with a LT debt-to-equity ratio of only 33.21%, well below the airline average of 154.48% Southwest possesses some of the strongest fundamentals in the industry. The company still has some room to run, as well; applying the current PE to the company’s projected EPS (from Fidelity) of 3.45 yields a target price of $54.06. Even using the industry average PE yields a target price of $38.92, which represents a 3% increase from the 9/2 close of 37.72. As such, barring any major increases in oil prices (here’s looking at you WTI 15% spike), I believe the company is a solid hold until Q3 earnings.</p> 
<p>Also, the company has no exposure whatsoever to China. Domestic revenues are tied entirely to the American economy, which I believe is positioned as an oasis in the weakening global economic climate. While global economic fears may temper the American economy’s strength, I feel that Southwest should largely be isolated from these fears.</p> 
<p><b>Position:</b> Hold until Q3 earnings, add on weakness</p>
