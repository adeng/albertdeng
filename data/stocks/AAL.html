<p>Purchased for pretty much the same reasons as Southwest Airlines (cheap oil). Instead of doubling down on Southwest, I decided to diversify and purchase a full service carrier. Relative to Southwest, American is a much larger carrier, both in terms of areas serviced and in terms of market capitalization. This size and exposure come with increased risk; with a beta of 2.71 versus Southwest’s 1.02 (from S&P CapitalIQ), American is also much more volatile. So why choose American? …I guess I’m just really bearish on oil.</p> 
<p>In Q2 2014, 28% of American Airlines’ operating expenses were related to fuel costs; this fell to only 20% in Q2 2015 due to a 37% decline in fuel costs. In comparison, Southwest’s fuel costs declined by only 31%. Furthermore, American possesses one of the newest fleets in the industry with an average fleet age of 12 years compared to Southwest’s 22 years. While Southwest and other airlines have begun fleet modernization initiatives, American is poised to capitalize on these low fuel costs now with its newer and more efficient aircraft.</p>
<p>In terms of valuation, American is relatively underpriced. Trading at only 7.14 times its TTM earnings, American falls well below the airline industry average TTM PE of 11.17. The company also possesses a PEG ratio of 0.48, which is 64% of the industry average PEG of 0.75. From a simple ratio standpoint, the company stands out as a bargain considering its record profits.</p> 
<p>While part of this undervaluation is due to tax implications, these tax implications don’t overshadow the company’s strong improvement in its net margin. Said tax implications, or the company’s recognition of its NOL carryforwards, reduced its effective tax rate from 28% in Q2 2014 to less than 1% in Q2 2015. Applying the 28% effective tax rate to Q2 pretax earnings would yield a Q2 net income $1,233.6 and EPS of 1.74, increasing its TTM PE to 7.98, which still falls well below the industry average and Southwest’s PE of 15.</p> 
<p>Of course, American is still a much riskier investment than its cousin Southwest, and I expect the price to fluctuate greatly in the near future (as I’ve already noticed for the past few weeks of owning American). However, I believe American to be a good hold to hedge against falling oil prices. With the Iran deal looking more and more likely, I expect the price of oil to fall even more in the near future, allowing American to soar higher. Fundamentally, however, I am concerned about the company’s decline in Q2 revenues; the majority of the company’s impressive Q2 results appear to be the result of its NOL carryforwards and low fuel costs. With analysts looking for a Q3 2015 EPS of 2.63, a 58% increase over its Q3 2014 EPS, I am concerned that the company may not be able to meet expectations. I will keep a close eye on this stock as we approach Q3 earnings, and will likely sell before earnings. </p>
<p>So this was kind of an accident. I set a stop loss order around 41.50 once the share price reached 41.80 to protect from any major price dips. I didn’t expect the stock price to shift so violently near the end of the trading day, which caused my shares to be sold prematurely. Still, a 4% gain is better than a loss, I suppose. Let this be a lesson to me to be more careful with my stop loss orders.</p> 
<p><b>Position:</b> Sold at 41.50 for a gain of 3.98%.</p>
