<p>Revised: 9/9/2015</p>
<p>One of 2015’s most anticipated tech IPOs, Box has had a pretty difficult trading year. Currently trading at 13.02 per share, almost a whole dollar below its IPO price of 14 per share, Box has suffered plenty enough this year. To be honest, I didn’t spend as much time researching this company as I should have. Rather, following months of decline, I believe this company to be fairly oversold, and I entered into a position in order to take advantage of the run-up to earnings. Whether I hold through earnings will depend on whether or not there are any major news releases to indicate a positive earnings beat.</p> 
<p>On earnings day 9/9, I set a stop loss order at 14.50 when the share price was around 14.67. I did so just in case the company didn’t beat earnings; if it didn’t, then I intended for the stop loss to kick in at market open the next day and sell as soon as possible. Unfortunately, (in hindsight, fortunately), the stop loss kicked in in the last hour of the day as the ticker fell below 14.50 and closed the day at 14.29. Although the stock beat earnings and jumped to 14.80 in after-hours, it was unable to hold the gain and traded down to close at 13.86 on 9/10. I do not plan on re-entering this stock in the near future as I purchased it for the sole purpose of trading on the earnings date.</p> 
<p>To be honest, this has been more of a gamble than a solid trade; while the run-up to earnings was anticipated, I got lucky with the stop loss order executing earlier than expected. Rationally, I should sell the stock before any major binary event in order to take profits and minimize risk, which is why this trade was so lucky. I am ashamed to admit, however, that I am not entirely rational; when the positive earnings data was released, I cursed myself for placing that order. It appears that when balancing potential gains versus safe capital growth, I focus too much on maximizing gains over minimizing risk, which is a very dangerous set of priorities. While I got lucky this time, there is no guarantee that I will in the future; as such, I will protect every one of my future earnings plays with stop loss orders and be more willing to take profits when necessary.</p> 
<p><b>Position:</b> Sold at 14.50 for a gain of 10.6%.</p>
