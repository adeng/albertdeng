     * 1000. If you wish, you can print only "interesting" solutions. That is, 
     * you can ignore solutions of the form x^3 + y^3 = x^3 + y^3 and solutions 
     * that are simple permutations of other solutions (swapping left and right 
     * hand sides, swapping a and b, swapping c and d). For example, if you were 
     * printing all solutions less than 20, you could choose to print only 
     * 2^3 + 16^3 = 9^3 + 15^3 and 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3.

     * For simplicity, you can assume that everyone is given a label from 0 to

     * 1) there can only be one celebrity at most.
     * 2) The knows function is the only way to look up who knows who.
